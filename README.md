I.	Background and Description 

Zeus Silog Point-of-Sale application is designed to streamline the food ordering process at Zeus Silog Hous; a dining establishment located in Balanga, Bataan.  Zeus Silog House offers various Filipino dishes including Bicol Express and Dinugan, all served with their signature Unlimited Rice and Silog, a popular Filipino breakfast dish. 

This program is capable of handling the orders of the customers by displaying the dishes they offer. Staff simply click on the desired item and specify the quantity. Additionally, this program can calculate the total amount of the order and the remaining balance upon inputting the amount of the customer's cash payment. Then the program will generate a receipt which you can view the order summary. 

On the other hand, the application still needs to be improved as it is not capable of handling inventory management. It cannot keep track of stock levels and display the real-time availability of dishes. Furthermore, this program is not capable of accepting other modes of payment other than cash payment. In the future, the developers aim to improve this program by adding features and functionality such as Sale Transactions, payment handling, inventory management, customer management, and employee Management.
